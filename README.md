# Project Overview
The City of Bern, also known as Berne, is the de facto capital of Switzerland. As of 2022, it has a population of approximately 144 447 inhabitants. While Bern is not the largest city in Switzerland, it ranks fifth in terms of population, following ZÃ¼rich, Geneva, Basel, and Lausanne. 
The goal of this project is to analyze historical data from 1941 to the present day for the city of Bern, Switzerland, and to forecast potential future changes in various elements.

# Data Sources
I accessed the [Open Government Data (OGD) portal](https://www.bern.ch/open-government-data-ogd/ogd-nach-themen), which provides public data on topics such as finances, statistics, geodata, and more. For this project, I focused on gathering the most comprehensive datasets available, spanning from 1941 to 2022. I identified five datasets of particular interest:
1. **arbeitslose_seit_1921**: Unemployment values.
2. **bevoelkerungsbestand_seit_1941**: Population values from 1941 onwards.
3. **bevoelkerungsbestand_und_haushalte_seit_1850**: Population and household data from 1850 onwards.
4. **natuerliche_bevoelkerungsbewegungen_seit_1890**: Data on marriages, divorces, births, and deaths from 1890 onwards.
5. **wanderungsbewegungen_seit_1900**: Migration data, including the number of arrivals and departures from 1900 onwards.
